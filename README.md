# meal-plan-showcase
Meal planning app.

The goal of this meal planning app is to have a user choose a recipe in the database, then create a shopping list of items the user needs for that resipe. When the user is at the store, they can check off purchased items.

Curerntly, a user is able to get one random recipe. 

Next steps:
* pulling in all recipes that a user inputs. For example, if a user types in chicken, bring up all recipes with chicken in it.

Future
* adding a calendar for meal planning
* shooping cart
